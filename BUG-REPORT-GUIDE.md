> We believe that bug reports should be short and sweet, yet informationally dense. This means we'll spend less time understanding the issue and more time fixing the bug

# Title

The title used for the bug report should also be used for the pull request. It should be concise and in this format:

Example:
```
[feat: FeatureName] Title
```
You may review the title again after completing the report to ensure it is concise and reflects the problem.

## Environment

The environment for every application can vary widely, but be as specific as you can.

- **Device:** What type of hardware are you using? Which specific model?

- **OS:** Which version number of the OS has displayed the issue?

- **App Version:** What is version number of the application? Avoid writing “latest version”
  
- **Connection type** (if applicable): If the app is reliant on Internet connectivity, are you on WiFi, Ethernet, or cellular data? What is the speed of the connection?

## Steps to Reproduce

Write the steps from beginning to end so we can easily follow through, repeating the same process

Example:
```
1. Go to settings > Profile (this would take user to new screen)
2. Tap on More Options > Delete Account
```
## Expected Result

What should happen when you click on this or that?

## Actual Result

Here’s the result of the bug. Does the application crash? Does nothing happen at all? Is an error displayed?

## Severity

**1. High/Critical**:  It blocks app usage or affects the normal usage

**2. Medium**: It affects the user experience

**3. Minor**: ALL else (e.g., typos, missing icons, layout issues, etc.) 

## Proof (optional)

Add any relevant screenshots or log files

## Suspected Problem/ Posible Fix (optional)

What do you think might be causing this problem? What have you tried that didn't work? Any possible fixes?
