## Reporting A Bug 

Open a new issue on the repository to report a bug.

Use [this bug report guide](https://github.com/d3vkk/open-source/blob/master/BUG-REPORT-GUIDE.md) and [this template](https://github.com/d3vkk/open-source/blob/master/BUG-REPORT.md) to write the bug report. 

## Submitting A Fix

We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). Pull requests are the best way to add changes to the codebase. 

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes where applicable.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request.

## Style Guide

- Lint and format your code using your preferred tools
- Spaces instead of tabs
- 2 spaces for indentation instead of tabs
